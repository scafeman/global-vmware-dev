# VCD NSX-T ALB Pool Module

This Terraform module will deploy a NSX-T ALB Pool into an existing VMware Cloud Director (VCD) environment. It can be used to provision a new ALB Pool, which represents a group of servers to which the load balancer can distribute traffic. This module can be used to provsion new ALB Pools into [Rackspace Technology SDDC Flex](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/software-defined-data-center-flex) VCD Data Center Regions.
